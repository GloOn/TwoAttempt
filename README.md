# TwoAttempt
This is my second attempt to upload a project to github, after so much trouble...
It seems ok now.

This is a project to develop a simple book database system with which user can add, edit, search and delete books.
It is a assignment of my course.
So much thank to my teacher Andy. He is a very good lecturer with great enthusiasum.
